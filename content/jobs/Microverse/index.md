- As a code Reviewer, I review technical projects made by students to better help them improve their technical skills including but not limited to giving feedback to improve their code quality, better collaboration, teamwork, and how to best present themselves as Developers.
- Mentored 40+ junior web developers, providing technical support through code reviews.
- Proposed improvements to code organization to improve code quality and overall performance.
- Delved and navigated through unfamiliar codebases, understood them, spotted bugs, and proposed fixes.
